					<p>Hello and welcome! I am Joanne and I am here to create great design that is beautiful and practical. I have a passion for ideas that leave a positive effect on people and transform the atmosphere around us. I come from all across the United States, which has given me the chance to travel, learn new cultures and ways of life, and gain communication skills. These experiences make me stronger and have given me a grasp on how design plays such an important roll in our lives. Through my adventures, I have taken the knowledge I have learned and put it into my work.</p>
					<p>As designers we think. We assess. We plan. We solve. Life as a designer is not just about creating beauty. It â€¨is also about creating functionality within our society. Design is all around us. Everywhere we turn, we are looking at something that was designed to communicate a message or stand for a specific purpose. However, it is the great designs that function properly to fulfill those expectations. Products are meant to serve a purpose. Good design happens when a product meets the criteria of practicality. Functionality juxtaposed with aesthetics is what I strive for in my work. I design as a way to solve a problem, a way to express ideas and advancements in everything from our day-to-day life to the world as a whole. I design to create meaning. I design to create purpose. I design to solve.</p>
